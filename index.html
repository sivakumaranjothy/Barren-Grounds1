    They were at the house now. Morgan didn't want to leave Misewa either just like Eli. They felt like having a lot of luxuries because it was different from huts and the small beds they slept on.  She saw her and her bioligical mother through the window. She felt like she could touch it. The mom looked at her when Morgan said I haven't forgot myself. She felt like a whole family.   They were laughing and full of hapiness.
